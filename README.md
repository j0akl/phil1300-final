# Jake's Blog

Built using routify, svelte, apollo, graphql, express, and mysql.

This is my personal blog, but I have built it with basic social media functionality
as a personal challenge.

This repository contains the frontend routify application only. The backend is located at https://github.com/j0akl/blog-backend
